# FPGA-BASED-DIGITAL-CIRCUIT-APPLICATIONS-USING-VERILOG

This repository contains a collection of digital circuit designs implemented using Verilog HDL, targeting FPGA platforms. The project bridges theoretical digital design concepts with practical hardware implementation, enabling simulation, synthesis, and real-time testing of various digital circuits.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- Designing digital circuits using Verilog.
- Verifying circuit functionality via simulation.
- Synthesizing and mapping designs onto an FPGA.
- Testing and validating the circuits in real hardware environments.

This approach provides a comprehensive workflow from HDL coding to deployment on FPGA boards, making it a valuable resource for both learning and application in digital system design.

## Features

- Modular Verilog code for different digital circuits.
- Testbenches for simulation and verification.
- FPGA synthesis-ready designs.
- Real-time hardware testing workflow.
